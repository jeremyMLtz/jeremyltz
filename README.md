# Welcome to My Corner of the Internet!

This is version 1 of my personal site. Here, I will be adding projects I'm working on and jotting down my thoughts.

## Development

First, let's set up the project!

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
```
Then simply run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

If you want to view the app in production mode you can do the following:

1. Build the application:
```sh
npm run build
```
2. Start the server in production mode:
```sh
npm start
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

This is done automatically when a branch is merged to main, thanks Github Actions!
